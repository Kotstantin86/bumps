Bumps
=====

BeagleBone Black cape hosting Pololu stepper driver boards (and derivatives).
This helps making use of readily available drivers.
Right now just an experimental board to make hacking on [BeagleG][beagleg-url]
simpler, but eventually meant to help have a full 3D printing
(and CNC) solution with BeagleBone + Bumps.
